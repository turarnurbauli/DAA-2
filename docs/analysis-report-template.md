# Analysis Report (Pair 4, Student B - Max Heap)

## 1. Algorithm Overview
- Problem definition, use-cases, theoretical background.

## 2. Complexity Analysis
- Time: Θ/O/Ω for insert, extract-max, increaseKey; best/worst/average.
- Space: auxiliary vs in-place.
- Optional: recurrences (if any) and solutions.

## 3. Code Review & Optimization
- Bottlenecks, constant-factor considerations, cache behavior.
- Proposed optimizations and expected complexity/constant-factor impact.

## 4. Empirical Results
- Setup: HW/SW, JVM flags.
- Plots: time vs n (random/sorted/reverse), CSV references.
- Validation vs theory, analysis of constants.

## 5. Conclusion
- Findings, recommendations, trade-offs.

## 6. Appendix
- Benchmark methodology, data tables, raw CSV.
